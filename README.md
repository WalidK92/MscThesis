The code below is to predict the undrained shear strength of cohesive soils. Prediction is accomplished using Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. An ensemble of all the aforementioned algorithms is also used for prediction. 

For the purpose of clear and quick execution, please follow the instructions placed the length of the code. Before attempting to run the code, ensure that the path of the provided Dataset is as it should be on your PC. Secondly, also ensure that the dataset you would like predictions to take place on is also properly provided so as to ensure errors are indicated. Furthermore, ensure the following packages are installed before attempting to run the code. 1) Caret 2) Metric. 

The Predictions will automatically be saved in the DOCUMENTS folder as ".csv" files. Feel free to check them out as soon as the code finishes its execution.
